        <h1> WEB OF NEEDS </h1>

        <p>
            The basic idea of the Web of Needs is to allow Web users to specify and publish their offers and needs on
            the
            Web, where suitable need/offer pairs can be found automatically and interact with each other using a shared
            protocol.
        </p>

        <p>
            This wiki is intended to give an overview of a technical approach to implement this idea, which is far from
            finished. For a condensed overview of the concept, read the ISWC 2011 Outrageous Ideas paper Building a Web
            of
            Needs
        </p>

            Currently the focus of implementation is the protocol, which is described herebriefly. The source code of
            the
            protocol will be made available shortly under an open source license.
