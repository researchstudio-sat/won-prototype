            The basic idea of the Web of Needs is to allow Web users to specify and publish their offers and needs on
            the
            Web, where suitable need/offer pairs can be found automatically and interact with each other using a shared
            protocol.
        </p>

            This wiki is intended to give an overview of a technical approach to implement this idea, which is far from
            finished. For a condensed overview of the concept, read the ISWC 2011 Outrageous Ideas paper Building a Web
            of
            Needs

            Currently the focus of implementation is the protocol, which is described herebriefly. The source code of
            the
            protocol will be made available shortly under an open source license.
